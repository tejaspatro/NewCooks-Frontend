- Pinchofyum.com & CodeWithHarry.com served as inspiration for UI and UX design
- Separate interface flows for Users and Chefs:

## üéØ User & Chef Interface Flow

- **Chef**
    - Separate dashboard to manage recipes
    - Add new recipes with image upload (via Cloudinary)
    - Edit & delete only their own recipes
    - View recipe statistics such as favorites and views

- **User**
    - Browse any public recipes
    - View recipe details (ingredients, steps, nutrition)
